		<intro>
			<p>
			   Creates a button widget with configurable text which emits reactivity events in component visualizations. These
		       events trigger partial re-execution within a component of downstream nodes, allowing users to leverage the power
		       of the KNIME Reactive Visualization framework and create interactive web applications and visualizations in real-
		       time.

	<interactiveView name="Refresh Button Widget">
		Displays a button with text and an optional label which emits reactivity events to re-execute downstream nodes.

		<outPort index="0" name="Flow Variable Output">
			Variable output port to connect to nodes which should be re-executed when the widget is clicked. Nodes downstream of
			a node connected to this flow variable output port will also be re-executed, so it's only necessary to connect to the
			root node in each workflow branch for which re-execution is desired. The flow variable value is trivial and does not
			contain any information.
