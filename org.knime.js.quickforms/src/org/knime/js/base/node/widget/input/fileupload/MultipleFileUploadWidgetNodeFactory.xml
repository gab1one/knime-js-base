		<intro>
			<p>
				Creates a multiple file upload widget for use in components views. The resulting table outputs the Path, the file name and the size of the file. 
			</p>
		</intro>
		<option name="Label">
			A descriptive label that will be shown in the view.
		</option>
		<option name="Description">
			Some lines of description that will be shown in the view, for instance by means of a tooltip.
		</option>
		<option name="Valid File Extensions">
			A list of file extensions that is used as filter in the file browser (not only the one in the "Default File"
			option but also in a remote file browser), e.g. ".csv,.csv.gz" will filter for files ending with ".csv" or
			".csv.gz". Leave empty to accept any file.
		</option>
		<option name="Default File">
			The file that will be used during design time, i.e. when no file is uploaded by means of the, e.g. 
			KNIME WebPortal.<br />
			It is possible to enter a URL here. This can be useful if a default file is to be addressed with
			the knime:// protocol (e.g. knime://knime.workflow/../data/file.csv) or if the file is present on
			a remote server.
		</option>
		<option name="Timeout">
			The time in seconds after which the connection times out. The timeout is used when testing the existence of
			default files. The default is set to 1 second and should be sufficient in most cases.
		</option>
		<option name="Disable output, if file does not exist">
			If enabled, output port will be disabled, if the provided file does not exist or cannot be accessed.<br />
			This option is helpful in the wizard (WebPortal) execution to keep this and subsequent nodes from failing 
			during execution.
		</option>
		<option
			name="Store uploaded file in workflow directory">
			Check this box to store the file in a temp directory in the workflow directory (e.g.
			/path/to/workflow/tmp/file_name). Otherwise, it will be created in the temp directory of the system, which 
			can lead to unwanted behaviour, i.e. reader nodes do not allow direct access to the file system on 
			KNIME Server or due to swapping a job between systems in a server/executor environment. Note that the 
			uploaded file will be deleted from the workflow when the workflow is discarded or reset.
		</option>
		<option
			name="Allow multiple file uploads">
			Check this box to allow the upload of multiple files at once.
			Each file will be represented as an individual row in the output table.
			It is only possible to set one default file.
		</option>
		<option
			name="File upload is required">
			Check this box to require the user to upload at least one file.
			If this box is checked and no file is provided the node will not execute.
		</option>

	<interactiveView name="File Upload">
		View containing the multiple file upload component. Please note that only small files should be uploaded when using
		the view inside the KNIME Analytics Platform (not on the WebPortal). If a large file is supposed to be selected 
		consider setting it as the default file or use the <i>Local File Browser</i> node. 
	</interactiveView>
	<ports>
		<outPort index="0" name="Uploaded files">
			Table output representing the uploaded files. Each files consists of a path, a filename and a size.
